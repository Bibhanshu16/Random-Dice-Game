# Random-Dice-Game
Overview The Dice Game is a simple and interactive web-based game where two players roll a virtual die on every page refresh. The player who gets the higher number wins, while a tie results in a draw. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a seamless and fun experience.
*How It Works*
Each time the page is refreshed, two dice are rolled randomly.
Player 1 and Player 2 are each assigned a random number between 1 and 6.
The results are displayed visually using dice symbols.
The player with the higher number wins. If both players roll the same number, itâ€™s a draw.
*Features*

Automatic winner declaration based on the dice rolls.
*Future Enhancements*
Adding a button to roll the dice instead of refreshing the page.
